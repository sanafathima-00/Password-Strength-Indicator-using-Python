# Password-Strength-Indicator-using-Python
1. **Flask Setup:**
    - The code imports the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.
    - It creates a Flask web application instance named `app`.
2. **Route Definition:**
    - The route decorator `@app.route('/')` specifies that the following function (`login()`) will handle requests to the root URL ("/").
    - The route accepts both GET and POST requests.
3. **Login Function:**
    - The `login()` function is called when a client accesses the root URL.
    - If the request method is POST (i.e., form submission), it retrieves the password from the form data.
    - It then calls the `check_password_strength()` function (which is a placeholder) to evaluate the password strength.
    - The strength result is passed to the template for rendering.
    - If the request method is GET (i.e., initial page load), it renders the `login.html` template without any strength information.
4. **Placeholder Function:**
    - The `check_password_strength(password)` function is a placeholder.
    - You should replace it with your actual password strength checking logic.
    - For now, it returns a static value ("Strong"), but you should customize it based on your requirements.
5. **Run the Application:**
    - The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the app runs only if the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).
    - It starts the Flask development server with debugging enabled (`debug=True`).
